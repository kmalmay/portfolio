                <h2>The Main Points.</h2>
                <hr class="hr-home">
                <h3 class="summary-h3">Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal for this project was to design a landing page from scratch, and then code the design into a responsive web page using the user stories on <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page" class="underline-effect">FreeCodeCamp’s project requirements</a> as guidelines.</p>
                <p>As the designer and developer of this landing page, my personal goal was to create a brand identity, describe the company, and highlight the subscription service for an online photo printer called The Gallery.</p>
                <h3 class="summary-h3">Outcome</h3>
                <p>The goals of the project were twofold, and I believe it accomplishes both well.</p>
                <ul></ul>
                <p>At a higher level, the project goal was to fully answer all of the user stories listed in the freeCodeCamp project description. I referred to these throughout the project, just as I would if I was working with real user stories. </p>
                <p class="support-txt emphasize-p">When I uploaded the project to CodePen and connected the freeCodeCamp test to find any errors, the project passed all of the tests.</p>
                <p>On a lower level, I had a personal goal for the project:  to create a landing page design I felt accurately represented the personality of the photo printing company and solved the problem of connecting the proper audience to The Gallery’s services. By thinking through the design problem at length before actually starting to design a page and by going through the process of creating wireframes and design iterations, I was able to better think through my design decisions.</p>
                <p class="support-txt emphasize-p">I believe the end design accurately creates a visual representation of the company’s brand and answers it’s goal to get people to sign up for their service.</p>
                <p>Were this a real product, I would put it to the test. First, I would have implemented moderated user testing on the prototype, prior to coding the design. After any changes were made and the page was live I would implement A/B testing with a couple of variations, changing the look or location of the sign up options to see which receives more hits.</p>

            <div class="case-study-summary">
                <h3 class="summary-h3">Process</h3>
                <p>First, I decided on a concept for the project: an online company providing photo storage, organization, and printing services to a target audience of couples and families.</p>
                <p>I started by thinking about what a company with solely an online presence would need on their website to attract customers. I also considered which demographic would be served and what the company’s brand personality should be to balance the product while also attracting the right audience.</p>
                <p>I chose bright colors and a playful header fonts to create an energetic feel. I wanted the color palette to mirror the exciting feeling of reliving special moments when reviewing photos. The colors needed to be fun, but also approachable. Thinking about who would use the service, I decided families and couples would be the primary target audience.</p>
                <h4>Fonts Used</h4>
                <p><b>Dancing Script:</b> This is a playful, approachable script font. Because it has a big personality I used it sparingly, just for the main heading and once more to highlight the main pricing plan. Dancing Script has the feel of movement and excitement that matches the mood the brand should convey.</p>
                <p><b>Lato:</b> Lato is a great offset to Dancing Script with its familiar, straightforward feel. With an audience of families and couples, this is a great font to add a sense of ease and familiarity. In addition, it’s very easy to read as a body text. Simply changing the weight of Lato to 300 for headings visually sets it apart to better create a sense of hierarchy, induces a more polished and sleek feel, and still matches it’s 400 weight body text counterpart.</p>
                <h4>Color Palette</h4>
                <p>I chose bright colors to convey a fun and happy exciting mood, but toned it down with a dark overlay in the header and footer temper the bright colors and tie them to a feel of stability and professionalism. The brand uses a complementary color scheme to create more contrast and a more energetic mood.</p>
                <div class="case-study-img">
                    <img src="assets/work/gallery-cs/gallery-color-palette-sm.png" alt="project color palette">
                </div>
                <p>Next, I brainstormed page sections and elements that should be included. Some things I knew would need were:</p>
                <div class="initial-proj-needs">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="support-txt">Place to sign up for the service highlighted at the top of the page</li>
                        <li class="support-txt">Section describing the service</li>
                        <li class="support-txt">Section breaking down the service plans and prices</li>
                        <li class="support-txt">Navigation bar at the top of the page and a footer at the bottom</li>
                        <li class="support-txt">Video to engage the audience in the services provided
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With these sections in mind, I created some rough wireframes for the page layout.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="wireframes-wrapper">
                    <div class="case-study-img">
                        <img src="assets/work/gallery-cs/wireframe1-sm.jpeg" alt="project wireframe for earlier iteration">
                    </div>
                    <div class="case-study-img">
                        <img src="assets/work/gallery-cs/wireframe2-sm.jpeg" alt="project wireframe formatting page sections">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>After going through several design iterations, I landed on the idea to overlay the main page information over a photo collage. I created the photo collage in Adobe XD and placed a transparent background over it so as not to distract from the foreground. The photos in the background help establish rapport with the target audience by showing photos of other families and couples. In addition, I created icons in Adobe XD to add visual interest to the first section describing the services offered.</p>
                <p>While designing landing page in Adobe XD, I ensured consistency in font sizing and heading usage so that when I coded it, I would not have to guess sizes. I also made sure that the various headings used consistent colors from the palette.</p>
                <p>After initially coding the project (HTML5 & CSS3) I posted it for feedback on the FreeCodeCamp forum where I got a lot of great recommendations and questions. During this testing process, I continued making changes to the landing page based on feedback from people reviewing the page. Then I would request further feedback. This process continued for a couple of days until I felt that the result accurately solved the goal of the project.</p>
